    Unstruwwel function processes a list of input strings and performs various operations on them.

    Args:

        language (list or None, optional): The language of each string in the input list. If None, language detection will be performed. Defaults to None.
        verbose (bool, optional): Whether to display verbose output. Defaults to True.
        scheme (str, optional): The scheme to use for processing dates. Valid options are "iso-format", "time-span", and "object". Defaults to "time-span".
